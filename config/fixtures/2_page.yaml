                                                    <p>When Parisian style maven Eveline Scotch (@evelinescotch) offered to curate her favorite pieces from our entire summer collection, we knew we were about to get the kind of honest insight that makes her 850K followers trust every recommendation. Eveline doesn't just pick pretty pieces—she chooses clothes that earn their place in a real wardrobe.</p>
                                                    <p>At 28, this former fashion journalist has built her reputation on one simple principle: style should enhance your life, not complicate it. When Eveline says something works, her followers listen, because they know she's thinking about whether they can actually wear it to brunch, pack it in a carry-on, or throw it on for an impromptu evening out.</p>
                                                    <p>After spending several weeks with our summer collection—wearing it, washing it, traveling with it—she's ready to share her top picks. These aren't just the pieces that photograph well; they're the ones that performed when it mattered most.</p>

                                                    <p>I spent weeks going through the entire dress collection, and I have to say, the quality really impressed me. What stood out were the thoughtful cuts that actually flatter real bodies, not just runway models. The fabrics feel substantial but breathable—exactly what you need when you're transitioning from beach clubs to evening dinners. I narrowed it down to my four absolute favorites, each with its own personality but all sharing that effortless elegance I'm always looking for.</p>

I tested several tops throughout my summer travels, and the ones that made my final cut are the pieces I kept reaching for again and again. They strike that perfect balance between relaxed and polished, and the fabric quality means they actually improve with wear instead of falling apart. These are the kind of tops that become your summer uniform.</p>

It wasn't necessarily the pieces I thought would work best, but the ones that performed in real life, through beach days, city exploring, and everything in between. The fit, the fabric, the versatility, my top picks nail all three. These are bottoms you'll actually want to live in.</p>
